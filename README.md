======
This project contains the source code the in-lcass demo for CSIS-1400: Introduction to Programming.  
All the examples are in Java.  Each version only includes elements of the Java language that have been introduced so far.
Also, each version builds on the last.  Once enough elements are present (conditionals and loops) there will be a 
fully functional Tic Tac Toe game.  Later versions will incporate language features to show how to write cleaner code.

And no, there are no homework answers here.  This code is similar but not exact.
